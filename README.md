# CSCI434/534 COLL 400 Capstone Project Report

## Overview
The COLL 400 capstone project involves monitoring and analyzing computer network traffic, specifically from popular internet websites like Amazon, Netflix, and Bank of America. Students will apply AI/ML, statistical, and mathematical knowledge to extract features from website traffic data and build models for automatic classification of the website of origin.

## Goals
1. Apply AI/ML, statistical, and mathematical knowledge in a real-world scenario.
2. Enhance teamwork skills through collaborative group work.
3. Engage with general end-users to obtain feedback on the project's classification capabilities and presentation accessibility.

## Requirements
- Work in teams of three to five.
- Present projects using PowerPoint slides.
- Submit a final project report, accounting for 20% of the final grade.
- Host all code and slides on a GitHub repository.

## Project Guidelines
### Objective
Develop models to classify web traffic origins without access to URLs or encrypted payloads.

### Dataset
- Must include output labels (originating website) and input features extracted from traffic data.
- Data collection methods: Manual collection via Wireshark or utilization of public datasets.

### Method
- Start with classic classification models (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, CNNs).
- Modify, combine, or develop new models to improve accuracy and efficiency.
  
### Evaluation
- Split data into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Establish baseline model for comparison.
- Compare proposed method against baseline using accuracy and F1-Score.
- Analyze results to understand strengths and weaknesses.

## Final Presentation
- Teams present using PowerPoint slides in the final week of the semester.
- Each team member receives the same grade for the project.
